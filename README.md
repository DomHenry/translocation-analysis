# Code and data to reproduce the results of an analysis of Egyptian Geese movements using a translocation experiment

## Instructions

Once you have downloaded/cloned the repository you will have to unzip the `data input` folder and keep it in the R project root directory. The code contained in the `src` folder is broken up into various steps which corresponds to the net-squared displacement analysis, the multivariate linear regression modelling, and visualisations of movement paths and data gaps.
